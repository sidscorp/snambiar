## Past Projects

#### Vaccine Clinic Scheduling & Staffing Calculator
> **Role**: Scientist and Developer
>
>> **About**: We developed a decision support tool to assist stakeholders involved in designing COVID-19 vaccination clinics to improve scheduling and staffing protocols based on operational and resource constraints by anyone with access to the internet and a web browser without the need for domain-specific knowledge or specialized software. This allows tool use by a larger section of the population which is vital during the current COVID-19 pandemic, as there currently exists several decentralized vaccination clinics within the US, each determining operational parameters independently of the rest of the distribution network. The tool can be accessed online at <a href="http://vaccine-calculator.snambiar.com" target="_blank"> this link</a>

#### FHIR Factories – An Evolving Digital Architecture to Scale Health Research
> **Funding Agency**: Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
> **Role**: Co-Investigator
>
>> **About**: This research is a grant awarded to MedStar Health Research Institite (PI: Dr. Kristen Miller) that aims to better understand the current state of open source, health IT tools through a rigorous evaluation including a landscape analysis including qualitative data collection and objective usability evaluations. The end goal of this work is to develop and optimize health IT infrastructure using enhanced data factory platforms (FHIR Factories), a more effective platform that provides researchers the ability to easily access high-quality data in standardized formats and leverage advanced analytic tools for more effective and efficient research.

#### Wearable Physiologic Monitor with Real-time Continuous Data Acquisition and Analysis for Early Detection of COVID 19 Infection 
> **Funding Agency**: Department of Defense (Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium)
> **Role**: Principal Investigator (MedStar Health Sub-award)
>
>> **About**: This project is a subcontract awarded to MedStar Health from Computer Technology Associates (CTA) and Sempulse Corporation and aims to develop modern artificial intelligence-based computer screening algorithms trained to identify variations in patterns in continuously monitored vital sign data for accurate, early detection and isolation of persons with unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 infections. 

#### District of Columbia Safe Babies Safe Moms Initiative 
> **Funding Agency**: A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation
> **Role**: Co-Investigator
>
>> **About**: This new initiative is a collaboration among four MedStar Health clinical programs that will come together to create a variety of services and programs that address the needs facing pregnant women, as well as their infants and toddlers. I was part of a very large group working on this project. My role included evaluating Social Determinants Of Health (SDOH) screening at various phases of pregnancy, and to develop algorithms aimed at identifying patients who could be at a higher risk for developing maternal health complications during their pregnancy and parenting journey.

#### Mobilizing a Million Hearts: Leveraging Health IT to Advance Clinical Knowledge and Care Coordination
> **Funding Agency**: Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
> **Role**: Co-Investigator
>
>> **About**: This project is a grant awarded to MedStar Health Research Institute (PI: Dr. Kristen Miller) leverages novel health IT architecture to transform a stand-alone calculator into an active cross-platform surveillance clinical decision support tool that integrates into clinician workflow. We will build and deploy a SMART on FHIR application (“Mobilizing Million Hearts”) that utilizes the risk factors of the Million Hearts Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk estimator and incorporates clinician user needs to inform clinical knowledge at the point of care.

#### SEPSIS: Sepsis Early Prediction Support Implementation System
> **Funding Agency**: National Science Foundation, Smart and Connected Health
> **Role**: Doctoral Research Associate
>
>> **About**: This research was a collaboration across North Carolina State University, Mayo Clinic, Christiana Care Health System, and MedStar Health (PI: Dr. Julie Ivy) which was aimed at overcoming the barriers associated with timely diagnosis and effective treatment of Sepsis by integrating electronic health records (EHR) and clinical expertise to provide an evidence-based framework to diagnose and accurately risk-stratify patients within the sepsis spectrum, and develop and validate intervention policies that inform sepsis treatment decisions.
