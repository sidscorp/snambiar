subtitle: A summary of my work
---
My background is in Industrial and Systems Engineering with a specialization in healthcare systems and processes. During my team in Graduate School at North Carolina State University, I was involved in efforts that use operations research (OR) and analytics to inform public policies on a population level as part of RA funded work. The primary project related to these efforts was the use of a detailed simulation model of individuals’ choice and response to public health type interventions for colorectal cancer screening. Furthermore, my dissertation aimed to improve hospital operational efficiency using dynamic programming and queueing theory to optimize different decisions within the health care process, such as patient flow and resource utilization. My prior experience also includes Social Network Analysis (SNA) and resource allocation under uncertainty. My research using SNA involved studying the user-engagement patterns in an online smoking cessation forum to develop a framework for prescriptive applied research. My interests in resource allocation under uncertainty led to my work on the sequential stochastic assignment problem (SSAP) which studies the allocation of available distinct workers with deterministic values to sequentially arriving tasks with stochastic parameters to maximize the expected total reward obtained from the assignments. All the projects I undertook during my time in graduate school had the underlying theme of incorporating the ‘human’ element in OR/Analytics models to influence policy on a large scale.

During my time as a Post-Doc at MedStar Health Research Institute, I continued participating in research efforts that use OR and analytics to inform public policies and to help improve access to healthcare. Some examples of projects that I was involved in include 1) building and evaluating a cardiovascular disease risk calculator that estimates a patient's future risk of having a heart attack or stroke, 2) developing dfecision support tools to enable physicians to identify if an incoming patient requesting prenatal care could be at a high risk of developing adverse maternal health outcomes, and 3) leading a project aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a biometric wearable device (containing Machine Learning algorithms) to identify the presence of COVID-19 infection, and 4) leading a project aimed at evaluating the state of Opioid Use Disorder screening and treatment among pregnant and parenting individuals within the District of Columbia.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to discuss any of my work. I love talking shop, be it over a virtual or an actual cup of coffee :)

## Past Projects

#### Vaccine Clinic Scheduling & Staffing Calculator
> **Role**: Scientist and Developer
>
>> **About**: We developed a decision support tool to assist stakeholders involved in designing COVID-19 vaccination clinics to improve scheduling and staffing protocols based on operational and resource constraints by anyone with access to the internet and a web browser without the need for domain-specific knowledge or specialized software. This allows tool use by a larger section of the population which is vital during the current COVID-19 pandemic, as there currently exists several decentralized vaccination clinics within the US, each determining operational parameters independently of the rest of the distribution network. The tool can be accessed online at <a href="http://vaccine-calculator.snambiar.com" target="_blank"> this link</a>

#### FHIR Factories – An Evolving Digital Architecture to Scale Health Research
> **Funding Agency**: Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
> **Role**: Co-Investigator
>
>> **About**: This research aims to better understand the current state of open source, health IT tools through a rigorous evaluation including a landscape analysis including qualitative data collection and objective usability evaluations. The end goal of this work was to develop and optimize health IT infrastructure using enhanced data factory platforms (FHIR Factories), a more effective platform that provides researchers the ability to easily access high-quality data in standardized formats and leverage advanced analytic tools for more effective and efficient research.

#### Wearable Physiologic Monitor with Real-time Continuous Data Acquisition and Analysis for Early Detection of COVID 19 Infection 
> **Funding Agency**: Department of Defense (Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium)
> **Role**: Principal Investigator (MedStar Health Sub-award)
>
>> **About**: This project will develop modern artificial intelligence-based computer screening algorithms trained to identify variations in patterns in continuously monitored vital sign data for accurate, early detection and isolation of persons with unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 infections. 

#### District of Columbia Safe Babies Safe Moms Initiative 
> **Funding Agency**: A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation
> **Role**: Co-Investigator
>
>> **About**: This new initiative is a collaboration among four MedStar Health clinical programs that will come together to create a variety of services and programs that address the needs facing pregnant women, as well as their infants and toddlers.

#### Mobilizing a Million Hearts: Leveraging Health IT to Advance Clinical Knowledge and Care Coordination
> **Funding Agency**: Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
> **Role**: Co-Investigator
>
>> **About**: This project leverages novel health IT architecture to transform a stand-alone calculator into an active cross-platform surveillance clinical decision support tool that integrates into clinician workflow. We will build and deploy a SMART on FHIR application (“Mobilizing Million Hearts”) that utilizes the risk factors of the Million Hearts Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk estimator and incorporates clinician user needs to inform clinical knowledge at the point of care.

#### SEPSIS: Sepsis Early Prediction Support Implementation System
> **Funding Agency**: National Science Foundation, Smart and Connected Health
> **Role**: Doctoral Research Associate
>
>> **About**: This research worked to overcome the barriers associated with timely diagnosis and effective treatment of Sepsis by integrating electronic health records (EHR) and clinical expertise to provide an evidence-based framework to diagnose and accurately risk-stratify patients within the sepsis spectrum, and develop and validate intervention policies that inform sepsis treatment decisions.
