## Past Projects

#### FHIR Factories – An Evolving Digital Architecture to Scale Health Research
> **Funding Agency**: Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
> **Role**: Co-Investigator
>
>> **About**: This research aims to better understand the current state of open source, health IT tools through a rigorous evaluation including a landscape analysis including qualitative data collection and objective usability evaluations. The end goal of this work was to develop and optimize health IT infrastructure using enhanced data factory platforms (FHIR Factories), a more effective platform that provides researchers the ability to easily access high-quality data in standardized formats and leverage advanced analytic tools for more effective and efficient research.

#### Wearable Physiologic Monitor with Real-time Continuous Data Acquisition and Analysis for Early Detection of COVID 19 Infection 
> **Funding Agency**: Department of Defense (Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium)
> **Role**: Principal Investigator (MedStar Health Sub-award)
>
>> **About**: This project will develop modern artificial intelligence-based computer screening algorithms trained to identify variations in patterns in continuously monitored vital sign data for accurate, early detection and isolation of persons with unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 infections.  My role on this project was to _____

#### District of Columbia Safe Babies Safe Moms Initiative 
> **Funding Agency**: A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation
> **Role**: Co-Investigator
>
>> **About**: This new initiative is a collaboration among four MedStar Health clinical programs that will come together to create a variety of services and programs that address the needs facing pregnant women, as well as their infants and toddlers.

#### Mobilizing a Million Hearts: Leveraging Health IT to Advance Clinical Knowledge and Care Coordination
> **Funding Agency**: Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
> **Role**: Co-Investigator
>
>> **About**: This project leverages novel health IT architecture to transform a stand-alone calculator into an active cross-platform surveillance clinical decision support tool that integrates into clinician workflow. We will build and deploy a SMART on FHIR application (“Mobilizing Million Hearts”) that utilizes the risk factors of the Million Hearts Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk estimator and incorporates clinician user needs to inform clinical knowledge at the point of care.

#### SEPSIS: Sepsis Early Prediction Support Implementation System
> **Funding Agency**: National Science Foundation, Smart and Connected Health
> **Role**: Doctoral Research Associate
>
>> **About**: This research worked to overcome the barriers associated with timely diagnosis and effective treatment of Sepsis by integrating electronic health records (EHR) and clinical expertise to provide an evidence-based framework to diagnose and accurately risk-stratify patients within the sepsis spectrum, and develop and validate intervention policies that inform sepsis treatment decisions.
